# Merge Types

## Introduction
- In Git there are different types of merges
- The intention of the merge is same - Merge changes from two branches in to one
- There are slight differences in the details when it comes to different types
- When a branch b1 is merged in to branch b2, there is a new commit in branch b2. This commit can be either `merge commit` or `squash merge commit`
